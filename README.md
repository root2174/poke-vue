# Pokedex

Built with Vue 3, Typescript and Vite, this is a simple pokedex project that allows the user to view all current pokemons
using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Functionalities

- User can click on any pokemon to view more details.
- User can search for any pokemon using the search bar.
- To optimize the application, only a few pokemons are loaded at a time, to load more, the user can click on the 'Load More' button.

The site is deployed at vercel: https://poke-vue-two.vercel.app/#/
